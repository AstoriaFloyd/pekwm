 pekwm INSTALL instructions
 --------------------------

 pekwm depends on a C++ compiler, X11 with support for the Shape
 extension and libXpm. A "normal" linux/bsd system has them all, under
 solaris/openwindows you need to install libXpm.

 Assuming that you allready have the sources and have them unpacked as
 you are reading this you just need to do:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ su
  # make install
 
 If something breaks while configuring, most likely you are missing libXpm
 or don't have your compiler or X11 set up ok.

 Now when you've installed pekwm, you need to make it start when you
 start X11, the most common way to do this is adding pekwm to your
 ~/.xinitrc file.
