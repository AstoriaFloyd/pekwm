	The pekwm Mousebindings go in <filename>~/.pekwm/mouse</filename>, and
	are very simple. They're divided up into two groups: The 'where' and
	'event'. Below is an example file:

	<para>Modifiers and mouse buttons can be defined as "Any" which is
	useful for Enter and Leave events. Any also applies as none.
	Motion events have a threshold argument. This is the number of pixels
	you must drag your mouse before they begin to work. Multiple actions can
	be defined for a single user action. Example:</para>
