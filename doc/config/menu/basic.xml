<title>Basic Menu Syntax</title>
<para>As previously indicated, the root and window menus follow the rules defined in 
<xref linkend="config-syntax"/>. There aren't many possible options,
and they're all either within the main menu, or within a submenu. This 
is all handled by a single file.</para>
<para>As addition to the default menu types, RootMenu and WindowMenu,
user can define any number of new menus following the same syntax.</para>
<para>Here's an example <filename>~/.pekwm/menu</filename> file, where
we have the usual RootMenu and WindowMenu and our own most used
applications menu called MyOwnMenuName:
