    <para>
      There are two pekwm mailing lists- pekwm-devel and pekwm-users.
      Which should you subscribe to? Well, that's for you to decide.
      Many people subscribe to both of them.

      is a basic questions mailing list- "How do I...", "Where do I...",
      "Check this out!", and so on. Talk between users is enquoraged, but
      advanced users will follow the list for questions, too.

      If you'd like to use filters with your mail program, you can
      check for mail-headers. Lists produce a List-Id: header which
      will contain the name of the mailing list (note that there's
      other information in that header, though the string
      'pekwm-listname' will be in there).
