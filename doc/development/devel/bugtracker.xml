<title>Bug Tracker</title>

<para>
	Pekwm bug tracker can be reached at <ulink url="http://pekwm.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/report">pekwm.org</ulink>.
	It's based on
	<ulink url="http://trac.edgewall.com/">trac</ulink>, so bugs are inside tickets. Tickets can be 
	<ulink url="http://pekwm.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/newticket">reported</ulink> and
	<ulink url="http://pekwm.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/report">viewed</ulink>.
	One can even include a patch to resolve one.

	Aside from bugs, tickets also eat feature requests.
