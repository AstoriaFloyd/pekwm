<title>Viewports</title>
<para>
Viewports are workspaces that are larger than the visible screensize.
This means you can have a big workspace in wich you scroll around freely.
By default pekwm uses a viewport that is 1x1 in size. This effectively
means that viewports are disabled. If you increase these numbers from
<filename>~/.pekwm/config</filename> to 3x3 (a three times three square),
you should be able to browse thru your now 9 times bigger workspaces
viewports with Mod4 and the keypad number keys. Also try dragging the
root window (background) with your left mouse button. More ways are
holding Mod4 and moving the mouse pointer over a screen edge or moving the
mouse to a screen edge and then pressing Mod4 and the left mouse button.

Usually when you drag windows over your left or right screen edge,
it will be moved to another workspace. However, when you press Mod4
while dragging the windows, they will move around in your viewport.
Usually viewports are defined as squares, so also try dragging over the
upper and lower screen edges.

Viewports are sometimes considered hard to visualize. To help this the
default keybindings to move around your viewport are arranged to your
keypad numbers. If you enable a 3x3 viewport, you can move around it
with Mod4 and the keypad numbers. Mod4+1 takes you to the lower left
segment of your viewport, Mod4+9 to the upper right, Mod4+5 to the
center and so on. Instead of thinking under what number your window is,
imagine it being "up on the left" or "down in the center".
Also consider using a pager application that handles viewports.

People usually disable multiple workspaces when they start using
viewports to avoid getting lost. However if you feel you aren't getting
lost, nothing stops you from using for example, ten workspaces with a
10x10 viewport.
