NEWS in pekwm-0.1.1
===================

NOTE.

This release mainly fixes bugs, but alot of them caused alot of code changes
so this might not be as stable as it should be.

WHATS NEW.

  * Keygrabber cleanups, three new grabs ActivateClientNum,
    ResizeHorizontal and ResizeVertical also it's now possible to disable
    keygrabber with the --enable/disable-keygrabber configure option.
  * Transient windows not unmapping should be fixed, this also led to the
    Workspace swtiching to fast bug to not appearing anymore.
  * Resize Behaviour altered and we now also have different pointers
    showing which way you're about to resize.
  * Window focusing reworked, still not 100% perfect but much is fixed.
  * Most ( All? ) XErrors fixed.
  * Small Extended Window Manager Hints fixes.
  * Window stacking fixes.
  * Configurable window placement.
