Welcome, distribution packagers! This quick guide exists to help you create a 
pekwm package for your distribution. First of all, thank you. We happily 
support any packages made for pekwm, as long as they follow the rules below.
If you make a pekwm package, let us know. We will host a copy on the pekwm
downloads area, and we will help your users with any problems.

1) DO NOT PATCH PEKWM FOR YOUR PACKAGE.

  If you _need_ to patch pekwm, because there is some vital bug that needs
  to be fixed, you MUST contact me, Claes Nasten <pekdon@gmx.net>, first and
  wait for my approval.
  
  Unofficial patches can create bugs, in code which the developers have
  not seen or approved, thus creating alot of extra work.
  So they are _strictly_ prohibited.

  If there's something you need to support in the build process, you can hop
  on irc.babblica.net/#pekwm and talk to me (eyez), or email me. My email
  address is rando@babblica.net, and I handle the entire build process. I 
  will be happy to work with you in a way that we can help.
  
2) Configure options

  We've had some problems with this before, so we've set up official rules 
  for distribution packagers. Specifically, there are some features we support 
  in pekwm, and some which are known not to work particularly well, and some 
  which we do not want in packages.
  
  If you'd like to make a pekwm package, please build with these options:
  
  ./configure --enable-shape --disable-xft --disable-xinerama \
              --disable-debug --enable-menus --enable-keygrabber \
              --enable-harbour --disable-pcre
  
  Distribution packages containing other features will not be supported, nor 
  will they be considered official.

3) Prefix and paths

  Our build system will honor your prefix/path requests. Many distributions
  expect something like this:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

  Be aware, though, that whatever you specify in sysconfdir will have /pekwm
  appended to it, so the above example would make config file defaults be in
  the directory /etc/pekwm/... --datadir defaults to $prefix/share, and also
  appends /pekwm. This conforms to numerous standards and proposals and such.

  When creating a package, if you do this:
  
  ./configure --prefix=/path/to/some/work/dir
  make
  make PREFIX=/usr install
  
  you can mess things up, because we hardcode a few paths into pekwm. The 
  proper way to do this is this:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
  make
  make DESTDIR=/path/to/your/build/dir install
  
Please follow these rules when making any pekwm packages.
