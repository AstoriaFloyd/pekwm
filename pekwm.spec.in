%description
Pekwm is a window manager that once up on a time was based on the aewm++ window manager, but it has evolved enough that it no longer resembles aewm++ at all. It has a much expanded feature-set, including window grouping (similar to ion, pwm, or fluxbox), autoproperties, xinerama, keygrabber that supports keychains, and much more.

    * Lightweight and Unobtrusive, a window manager shouldn't be noticed.
    * Very configurable, we all work and think in different ways.
    * Automatic properties, for all the lazy people, make things appear as they should when starting applications.
    * Chainable Keygrabber, usability for everyone.
