README for pekwm-0.1.1
======================

ABOUT.
	Well, the old docs that were valid for pekwm-0.1.0 were a bit
too outdated because of too many changes in config file formats etc for
me to think it was sane to include them.
	Why? Why was this piece of software made? Well, I need to have
something to spend my time with ( not as if I allready hadn't enough
things to do ) and then I found out about
aewm++ ( http://sapphire.sourceforge.net ) which I started to hack
on, first adding support for xinerama and a config file, plain basic
"needed" stuff IMHO. I kept on hacking _but_ I got to far away from
the aewm++'s author ideas about what he wanted to do with aewm++ so
he didn't want to include my changes.

DOCS.
	Anyway, a nice fellow named Rando Christensen
<rando@babblica.net> is working on the docs for pekwm and they aren't
100% complete yet but be patient, this is just a pre release.
