 -------------------------------
 
 pekwm is written by me, Claes Nasten <pekdon at pekdon dot net> and the code
 is based on the aewm++ window manager, but it has evolved enough that it
 no longer resembles aewm++ at all. It also has an expanded feature-set,
 including window grouping (similar to ion, pwm, or fluxbox),
 auto properties, xinerama and a keygrabber with keychains support.

 Full documentation for this project can be found in the docs/ dir or at
 the pekwm homepage and they are maintaned by
 Rando Christensen <rando@babblica.net> and Jyri Jokinen <shared@surffi.net>
