    ( Thanks Rando Christensen <rando@babblica.net> for this work )

2002-10-18
(config.cc, config.hh)
  * Moved the mouseconfig out from config to a separate file called mouse.

(theme.cc, basemenu.cc)
  * Fixed issue with text in the status window not beeing visible if
    pekwm was compiled withouth menu support.

2002-10-15

2002-10-14
(harbour.cc, harbour.hh, config.cc, config.hh, pekwm.hh)
  * Added Placement and Orientation support for the harbour.
    Options:     
      Placement = "Top | Bottom | Left | Right"
      Orientation = "TopToBottom | BottomToTop | LeftToRight | RightToLeft"
    This relods when reloading the config, also the stacking is uppdated.
	
(frame.cc)
  * Fixed a bug causing Client actions with modifiers be executed twice.
    ( Thanks shared for reporting. )

2002-10-13
(frame.cc)
  * Reverted the look of the WireFrame to only a rectangle to fix issues
    when moving/resizing borderless windows.
    ( Thanks Jeremy Naylor <jnaylor@cisco.com> for reporting )

2002-10-12
(harbour.cc, harbuor.hh, workspaces.cc)
  * Reworked the stacking of the harbour so that it shouldn't flicker anymore.
    Still, changed harbour stacking from Above to Below requries a restart for
    changes to take full effect.

(frame.cc)
  * Tuned the warping of the pointer when using WorkspaceWarp to make
    a bug not possible or atleast harder to reproduce.

(frame.cc)
  * Fixed a redraw issue when resizing windows.
    ( Thanks shared for reporting. )

2002-10-08
(*)
  * Focus code rewritten, still not there yet, do expect glitches.

  * Cleanups.

2002-10-02
(client.cc, client.hh, actionhandler.cc, config.cc, pekwm.hh)
  * We now have both a Close and a Kill action, the close one sends an
    WM_DELETE message if the client supports it, and the kill one kills
    it with XKillClient.

(config.cc, keys.cc)
  * Changed the behaviour of mods on keygrabs and button actions, if you don't
    use the Mod keywoard it'll grab withouth any modifier making the None
    modifier keyword obsolete.

(*)
  Config file parsing is rewritten, this included the most of Config and Theme
  to be rewritten too. The new base syntax is:

    Section {
      Name = "Value"
    }

  Which hopefully is alot easier to read.
  This also causes all configuration files _and_ themes not to work as they
  need to be rewritten to the new format.

2002-10-30
(frame.cc, config.cc, config.hh)
  * Added two new options:
	WorkspaceWarpResistance* unsigned int;
	WrapWorkspaceWarp* bool;

2002-10-29
(frame.cc)
  * Reworked moving of windows so that you'll now get the status window
    even if you move in Opaque mode.

(config.cc, config.hh, frame.cc)
  * Added new option, OpaqueResize which will if it's set to true resize
    while showing it's content. Also, WireMove was removed and replaced
    with OpaqueMove, which is the same option but inverted.

(keys.cc, config.cc, pekwm.hh, actionhandler.cc, frame.cc, frame.hh)
  * Added new keybinding, MoveToCorner which takes one parameter, which can
    be one of the following:
	TopLeft, TopRight, BottomLeft or BottomRight
    which moves the active window to that corner of the screen.
	
(util.cc)
  * Added function trimLeadingBlanks for use in parsing code.

2002-10-27
(baseconfig.cc, baseconfig.hh, config.cc, rootmenu.cc, keys.cc, autoprops.cc)
  * Cleaned up in BaseConfig and altered default constructor and load
    behaviour while adding support for loading configs from a FILE object.

2002-10-24
(workspaces.cc, workspaces.hh, frame.cc, config.cc, config.hh)
  * Implemented Frame-to-Frame snapping and therefore added a new configuration
    option, FrameSnap which is amount of pixels between two frames before it
    snaps. If it's 0 no snapping occurs.

    NOTE: EdgeSnapWidth config option is replaced with the EdgeSnap config
    option which no longer is a bool, it's now a unsigned int.

(client.cc, client.hh, config.cc, actionhandler.cc, pekwm.hh)
  * Added three new key grabber commands:
  	ToggleBorder, ToggleTitlebar and ToggleDecor

2002-10-23
(image.cc)

(*)
  * Basic DockApp support via the harbour, still it is in early stage
    of development. Enable via compile time option --enable-harbour

(basemenu.cc, basemenu.hh, windowmanager.cc)
  * Altered the behaviour of menus, items are now selected if you enter a
    submenu. Also, the selected item has two lines on it, and it's possible
    to give the menus name with the MenuName keyword.

2002-10-19
(genericmenu.hh)
  * Fixed missing include guard in genericmenu.hh

(client.cc)
  * If a transient window unmaps, we only give the parent focus if the
    transient window was focused.

(client.cc)
  * Fixed small issue in handleMapRequest, we didn't look wheter or not we
    were on the active workspace, causing mozilla to map where it
    shouldn't.

2002-10-17
(client.cc, client.hh, frame.cc, frame.hh, workspaces.cc, windowmanager.cc)
  * Reworked hiding and unhiding of clients/frame as
    Rando Christensen <rando@babblica.net> reported that the
    switch-workspace-to-fast still existed but were really hard to replicate.

(windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh, workspaces.hh)
  * Added method findClientToFocus in WindowManager which tries to find a
    client that can be focused. Also, using this the last focused client
    is remembered when you kill a client or whatever.

(button.cc, button.hh, frame.cc, theme.cc)
  * Fixed a bug causing pekwm to segfault if you used button 4 or 5 ( usually
    the scroll wheel ) on the titlebar buttons. Also, while I were at it
    I added support for configuring all 5 buttons for each button.
    ( Thanks Holger Schibalsky <schibalsky@web.de> )

2002-10-16

    loading from a theme with border at the top one without caused troubles.

2002-10-11
(client.cc, client.hh, frame.cc)
  * Reworked unmap handling, now we "filter" the unmap events we cause
    and then we can listen on the "real" events, wich hopefully resolvs
    the unmap issues of pekwm. Also, this rework seemed to resolv the
    to fast Workspace switching bug.

(workspaces.cc)
  * Added check to make sure that the last focused client aren't hidden
    before activating it.

2002-10-10
(basemenu.cc)
  * Fixed XErrors related to trying to set menu height to 0.

(keys.cc, theme.cc, client.cc, frame.cc)
  * Fixed some compile warnings uncovered with -Wall.

(theme.cc)

    start if there weren't any clients on the screen and menu support weren't
    compiled in.

(*)
  * Renamed the USE_XFT and USE_MENUS defines to XFT and MENUS.

2002-10-09
(windowmanager.cc)

(*)
  * Uppdated the default theme, removed the what-took-so-long theme.

(windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh, frame.cc, client.cc, client.hh)

    because of it beeing resized because of struts.

2002-10-02
(windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh, client.cc, keys.cc, keys.hh)
  * Added new compile time option, --enable/disable-keygrabber wich
    decides wheter or not keygrabber should be enabled. It defaults
    to true. ( Thanks ? for request )
    This speeded things up alot, what's up with keygrabbing taking so
    much time? Needs investigation.

(client.cc, windowmanager.cc)

    between workspaces with gnome-panel etc. Also cleaned a little.

    end with Exit.

2002-06-28:
()
  * Added commmon actionhandler for keygrabber, rootmenu, windowmenu,

  * Now it's possible to configure mouse button actions, the configuration is
    put into the main config file (~/.pekwm/config) and the syntax follows

      root.click* Button:Action:Param; ( root window clicks )
      client.click* Button:Action; ( client clicks )
      client.click.double* Button:Action; ( double clicks on clients )

    Valid root click actions are:
      ShowRootMenu ( toggles root menu visibility, and hides all other menus )
      ShowIconMenu ( toggles icon menu visibility, and hides all other menus )
      HideAllMenus ( hides all menus )
      NextDesktop ( goes to the next(right) desktop )
      PrevDesktop ( goes to the previous(left) desktop )
      Exec ( executes a command )

    Valid client click actions are:
      Raise ( raises the frame )
      Lower ( lowers the frame )
      Shade ( shades the frame )
      Maximize ( maximizes the frame )
      ShowWindowMenu ( toggles window menu visibility )
      NextInFrame ( activates the next(right) client in the frame )
      PrevInFrame ( activates the previous(left) client in the frame )
      ActivateClient ( activates the client that is under the pointer )

pekwm-0.1.0 released

2002-06-19
()
  * NOTE! the changelog from aewm++-1.0.16 to pekwm-0.1.0 isn't very detailed,
    alot more minor and major things have changed in the source that isn't
    documented here, and therefore you should _not_ blame the author of
    aewm++ for any bugs in the source.

2002-06-19:
(hints.cc, hints.hh)
  * Merged gnome_protocols bugfix from aewm++-1.0.17.

(basemenu.cc, windowmanager.cc)
  * Changed the behaviour of basemenu, clicking a submenu will just toggle it's
    visible state, not hiding the whole menu.

2002-06-18:
(hints.cc, hints.hh, client.cc, frame.cc)
  * Mimimal support for GNOME_WIN_LAYER so now i.ex. nautilus will start on
    the desktop.

(windowmanager.cc, client.cc, client.hh, keys.cc, keys.hh, windowmenu.cc)
  * Added always below toggle to clients, it's in the window menu and
    keygrabber(AlwaysBelow).

(frame.cc, windowmenu.cc, basemenu.hh)
  * If you Alt+Mouse3 click windows they'll get lowered. Also, raise and lower
    is added to the windowmenu.

(client.cc)
  * Fixed gnome (win_state_sticky) state togglling bug.
    (Thanks Frank Hale for info)

2002-06-14:
(frame.cc)
  * Fixed bug in fixGeometryBasedOnStrut making it impossible to get larger
    windows than the screen size. (Thanks Z3l3zT for bugreport)

2002-06-13:
(basemenu.cc, basemenu.hh)
  * Readded widgets for submenus, now the size are relateive to the font size.

2002-06-12:
(button.cc, button.hh, theme.cc, theme.hh, frame.cc)
  * Now buttons can han variable button width, tough the different states will
    will still have the same width tough.

(baseconfig.cc, baseconfig.hh, keys.cc, theme.cc, rootmenu.cc)
  * Made it possible to have more than one char as separator when using
    BaseConfig::splitString

(basemenu.cc, basemenu.hh)
  * Basemenu cleanups, better xinerama support and less code.

2002-06-11:
(windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh, keys.cc, keys.hh)
  * Added basic AltTabbing support (NextFrame)

(client.cc, basemenu.cc)
  * Fixed some ops about position.

2002-06-10:
(client.cc, client.hh, frame.cc, frame.hh)
  * Added support for Alt dragging windows, so if you hold alt and press the
    clients window and drag the window should follow.

2002-06-07:
(windowmanager.cc, keys.cc)
  * m_focused_client = client; isn't used for setting the focused client
    anymore, now setFocusedClient is used instead pretty much eliminating
    the use of unfocusAllClients. Also, this resulted in less buggy focus
    code making the keygrabber use the focused client instead of the client
    wich were beneath the pointer.

2002-06-06:
(windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh)
  * Well, doEventLoop got split up in _smaller_ parts, all events except the
    shaping events got their own function, to get more overhead.

2002-06-05:
(frame.cc, frame.hh, client.cc, client.hh)
  * Reworked the constructors of the two classes, and changed back the
	  initPositions to the Client(maybe should be in WindowManager)

(client.cc)
  * Now handling the vertical and horizontal maximized hints separate.

2002-06-03:
(frame.cc)
  * Fixed bug when inserting a client with shade state != the frames shade
    state that made it necessary to double-click twice to unshade the frame.

(windowmanager.cc)
  * Fixed bug in findTransientToMapOrUnmap causing the transient windows not
    unhiding if they were hidden on another desktop. (Thanks Z3l3zT for bugreport)

2002-06-02:
(windowmanager.cc)
  * Switching desktop will now focus the client that is ontop(focus click) or
    the client that the is under the mouse (focus {sloppy, follow})

(iconmenu.cc, windowmanager.cc)
  * Now it's possible to uniconify clients independt of where they were
    iconified, an item will have an <DeskNumber> appended after its name.
(windowmanager.cc)
  * Fixed some focusing issues making it impossible to use keygrabber when
    iconifying windows and not having anyone left (Thanks Z3l3zT for bugreport)

()
  * Not using LinkedList anymore, using std::vector now instead.

2002-06-01:
(config.cc, rootmenu.cc, keys.cc, theme.cc)
  * They now use DATADIR instead of PREFIX/share/pekwm for default data dir

(*Makefile*, config.mk)
  * Rewrote the Makefiles and added makefiles for the config files and themes.
	  Also added config.mk for easier configuration.

(basemenu.cc, basemenu.hh, windowmenu.cc, rootmenu.cc, rootmenu.hh, windowmanager.cc)
  * Now it's possible to actually make use of the submenu functionality in the
    BaseMenu class. Therefore uppdated the windowmenu(Send To is now separate)
    and made it possible to have submenus in the rootmenu:
      sub* SubMenuTitle; will start a submenu with title SubMenuTitle
      end* ; Will end the current menu

()
  * Cleaning headers and added some small functions to make life cleaner

(windowmanager.cc)
  * Changed beahviour of windowmenu, now it'll hide showing another menu or
    clicking somewhere on the root window with mouse{1, 2, 3}

2002-05-31:
()
  * Now compiles nicely with Intel C++ 6.0. My bad it didn't! :/

2002-05-30:
(frame.cc, frame.hh)
  * Window buttons behave more normal now, resize works when pressing it
    directly, and you won't be able to move windows by holding the button and
		draging anymore.

(windowmanager.cc, basemenu.hh, windowmenu.hh)
  * Added "Always On Top" to the windowmenu, also if there are an ontop
    window in a frame-group the frame will only get raised if the active client
    is the one having AlwaysOnTop set.

2002-05-29:
(frame.cc, frame.hh, button.cc, button.hh)
  * Made frames think more of transient clients when there are more than one
    client per frame.

(theme.cc, theme.hh, config.cc, config.hh)
  * Now we are using themedir instead of themefile in the config file, also
    the themes have all pixmaps relative to that dir in the theme files.

2002-05-27:

2002-05-26:
(button.cc, button.hh, theme.cc, frame.cc)
  * Added ShowMenu to the list of actions buttons can have.

(button.cc, button.hh, theme.cc, frame.cc, frame.hh)
  * Changed button syntax, now it's possible to have buttons aligned either
    left or right, new syntax is.

    win.button.left* and win.button.right*

(config.cc, config.hh)
  * Now config files are copied to the users home dir if the config file
    doesn't exist in the dir ~/.pekwm/

2002-05-23:
(button.cc, button.hh, frame.cc, frame.hh, theme.cc, theme.hh)
  * Added basic pixmap themeing of titlebars (tiled pixmaps, focused, unfocused
    and selected(not yet done)) , also the button box isn't there anymore. It's
    been obsoleted by configurable buttons who also are pixmap themeable.
    Button config syntax goes like this:

    win.button* ActionB1 ActionB2 ActionB3 :FocusedXPM UnfocusedXPM PressedXPM;

    And possible actions are (Maximize, MaximizeVertical, MaximizeHorizontal,
    Resize, Shade, Iconify, Stick, AlwaysOnTop, Close,
    NextInGroup, PrevInGroup and NoAction)

(frame.cc,frame.hh,keys.cc)
  * Now MaximizeVertical and MaximizeHorizontal actually works.

2002-05-17:
(keys.cc, keys.hh)
  * Parsing seems to work fine now, cfg file syntax is:
    Action* Mods Mods Key : Parameter;	
  * Added more keybindings: NudgeHorizontal(int inc), NudgeVertical(int inc),
    NextInGroup, PrevInGroup and Stick.
  * As I added Stick I fixed so that clients in a sticky group(groups becomes
    if any client in it is sticky) are ungrouped they ungroup on the current
    desktop.

2002-05-16:
(keys.cc, keys.hh, baseconfig.cc, baseconfig.hh)
  * Partially working config file parser, also added function splitString to
    BaseConfig.

2002-05-16:
(keys.cc, keys.hh)
  * Added more keybindings: Maximize, Shade, Iconify, Close, SendToDesk
    GoToDesk and Exec.

2002-05-15:
(keys.cc, keys.hh)
  * Added Keys class wich handles keyaction, also rewrote the keygrabbing
    mechanism. What's still to do is add alot of action, only new so far
    is Exec. Also key config file parsing needs to be done.

2002-05-14:
(basemenu.cc)
  * Fixed ops in updateMenu causing the menus not acting to events as supposed
    after more than 1 updateMenu().

2002-05-13:
(fram.cc, client.cc)
  * Well, now iconification works rather good, but expect some glitches here
    and there.

2002-05-09:
(windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh, misc.cc, misc.hh)
  * Moved the signal handler and X error handler to windowmanger.cc, also made

2002-05-09:
(frame.cc, client.cc, client.hh)
  * Added m_is_hidden to Client and I'm now using m_ignore_unmap as a counter,
    that gets decreased everytime handleUnmapEvent is called. Seemed to resolv
    the ignore_unmap bug. :)

2002-05-07:
(frame.cc, frame.hh, client.cc, client.hh, windowmanager.cc)
  * Multiple clients per frame is working, probably are tons of bugs lurking
    tough.

2002-04-29:
(iconmenu.cc)
  * Fixed potential memory leak, creating unused BaseMenuItems

2002-04-26:
(*.cc, *.hh)
