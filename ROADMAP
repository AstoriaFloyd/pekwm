 pekwm ROADMAP
 -------------

0.1.2 - The coming release	
	 ***** Released November 18th, 2002 *****
     This is the next version of pekwm to be released. some changes include:
       - Basic Harbour (dockapp) support
       - New config file syntax
       - Workspace warping
       - Opaque Resize
       - New Keybindings to toggle border/titlebar/decorations
       - Move to corner keybinds
       
0.1.3 - The Harbour
     This release will be all about the harbour- After this point, it should 
     be "complete". Includes:
       - Adding harbour resize support
       - docking any application in the harbour
       - Fixing Harbour bugs
       
0.1.4 - Theming
     This release is focused on fixing themes- If you download a 0.1.4 theme,
     it should work for as long as we can possibly get it to work. The plan is
     to stabilize the theme spec at this release, and not change it unless we
     have a REALLY good reason to. (Of course, we can still add features, but
     we won't break anything.) Changes include:
       - New theme format
       - pekwm-specific background setting program
       - Themes will work without changes no matter where they're installed

0.2.0 - Complete Syntax file Freeze
     The syntax for all files should not be changed between 0.2.0 and 1.0. 

0.99.* - The road to 1.0
     In these releases, we're just getting ready for a 1.0 release. Some
     changes scheduled include:
       - More placement models
       - Improving image handling
       - Improving Extended WM Hints spec compliance
       - Better autoprops handling
       - Stabilize and Optimize
